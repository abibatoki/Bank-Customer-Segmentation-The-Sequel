# Bank Customer Segmentation – The Sequel

This project continues the work from **(https://github.com/abibatoki/Bank-Customer-Segmentation)**, where I grouped banking customers into segments based on their behavior patterns and value to the business. This sequel transforms those insights into an interactive dashboard that enables anyone to dynamically explore the segmentation results.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to make customer segmentation results easier to explore and interpret by:

- Presenting the data visually through a clean, interactive interface.
- Allowing city-by-city exploration of customer behavior.
- Providing quick access to segment definitions and business interpretations.

This approach makes it possible to see the local variations in customer engagement, spending, and loyalty.
